# Gellish
Development of tools for using Formal English and other Gellish Formal Languages.  
I am an IT ontologist with an engineering background and I worked for about 35 years in IT for Shell. Because of Shell's urgent need for data integration, data exchange and interoperability of internal systems and systems of suppliers, I worked for over 20 years on interoperability standards and consultancy. 
As a result I have developed a family of universal data exchange languages, called Gellish. Formal English is the Englishh variant of that family. Formal English is a formalization of a natural English, which means that Formal English is machine interpretable as well as human readable. Formal English (and Formal Dutch) is widely applicable and is proven to be suitable for modeling the whole life-cycle of all kinds of facilities and infrastructure and their components design and operation, as well as business processes. 
The language definition includes a language defining ontology and taxonomic dictionary, together with a syntax that is called the Gellish Expression Format. The language principles are described in my PhD and its application is documented in various books and documents: see: www.gellish.net
This project is meant to develop open source tools to support the implementation and usage of the various variants of the family of formal languages.
